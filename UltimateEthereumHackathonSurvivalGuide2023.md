#### What are Hackathons?

Hackathons are events where teams compete under a deadline to create a minimum viable product that solves a real-world issue. They are usually hosted on weekends and last around 48 hours. After COVID-19, most are hosted online and last between one to four weeks. These types of events allow you to participate from anywhere in the world!

Ethereum hackathons are excellent opportunities to:

-   make new friends and connections worldwide
-   get hands-on development training
-   stay up to date with the latest tools
-   develop your web3 portfolio outside of work
-   learn new technologies in a bounded period
-   find a job from companies looking to hire
-   gain interest from venture capitalists and investors for your startup or any future startups
-   develop a name for yourself
-   get exclusive swag
-   start a startup
-   build cool stuff!

By expanding your network of developer friends, you can find referrals to unlisted opportunities, find possible co-workers in a startup, create a startup, or have cool people to talk about crypto. So whether you’re competing virtually or in the real world, hackathons can provide you with a place to go deeper into the rabbit hole that is web3.

Currently, the gold standards for web3 hackathons are those hosted by [EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) and [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon-list/). Both provide a [massive amount of training](https://www.youtube.com/c/ETHGlobal/playlists) and hands-on experience. Sign up for EthGlobal’s [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ETHGlobal), browse the history of presentations from past events, and gain inspiration from [projects of past events](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/).

The Ethereum community is evolving and growing quickly! By joining and participating in hackathons you can rest assured that you will stay up to date and at the cutting edge.

The fastest way to a career in web3 is through participating in a hackathon and finding friends at [your local Ethereum meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pro/BUIDL/).

> Hackathons are for everyone!

Hackathons offer a place to learn new technologies with others in an applied manner. Do not get caught up with “impostor syndrome” and feel like you are not good enough to participate. Hackathons are places to learn and grow!

> What is imposter syndrome?

Imposter syndrome is when a person feels like they are not adequate to participate in an activity or organization. No matter where you are skill wise, you can start today!

### Learning Web3

If you have time to prepare before the hackathon, go through these resources to learn how to build your first sample decentralized applications (DApps).

This section focuses on helping you learn about web3 and developing DApps on Ethereum based networks.

#### Overview of a DApp

DApps are like regular applications, except they leverage blockchain-based smart contracts as part of their back-end logic. Like traditional legal contracts, smart contracts are useful for social collaboration. Because they are on impartial blockchains, Smart contracts can create networks of cooperation towards a common goal.

A DApp’s stack is similar to a regular full-stack application. However, a key distinction is that DApps leverage smart contracts and contain hooks for interacting with them via a wallet.

If you come from the web2 world, you will most likely focus on:

-   how to use wallet APIs,
-   use frameworks to write and manage the life cycle of smart contracts,
-   learn Solidity securely,
-   understand the general architecture of a blockchain network.
-   you will need to develop an intuition of what applications are best suited for a blockchain and which are not on the meta-level.

The overwhelming majority of a DApp is front-end code, followed by state management, then large amounts of testing, and finally smart contracts. Although Solidity is the smallest amount of code, it requires the most attention due to its security implications. In production, smart contracts could handle billions of dollars. However, getting them to work on a test network is fine enough for a hackathon.

#### DApp overview:

-   Optional Theming library (Chakra, React Bootstrap, etc.)
-   MetaMask API / Web-3-react (Wallet API and hooks to interact with smart contracts)
-   Optional Front End Library for web3 UX/UI (Drizzle, web3)
-   Library to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain (Web3js or EthersJS)
-   Front End Library (React, VueJS, VanillaJS / jQuery)
-   Testing Library (Jest, Mocha & ChaiJS)
-   Solidity

Zooming into the Solidity code, there are various dependencies, namely the smart contract development framework and secure, audited libraries to provide your contract’s base.

#### Solidity:

-   Actual Solidity Code
-   Truffle / Hardhat / Forge / Brownie (smart contract development framework)
-   OpenZeppelin (The gold standard library of secure, audited contracts)
-   Solc (Solidity compiler)
-   Solidity syntax highlighting for code editor
-   Scribble, a runtime verification tool and domain specific language to reliably test assertions. This is optional for hackathons. But increasingly necessary for production level projects. Go beyond testing your code! Fuzz your code!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*p9BR21Agbno3v9O71VMdZg.png)

A sample DApp file structure with React and Truffle

First you set up the Truffle smart contract framework. This sets up the contracts portion. Then inside of that root directory you will set up your User interface with React or your favorite front end library.

A barebones sample setup code would be to run in the command line:

mkdir your-project  
cd your-project  
truffle init  
npx create-react-app src

Note: you can use [web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) or [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers).

yarn add web3-react @truffle/hdwallet-provider dotenv @openzeppelin/contracts web3-react web3

Or

yarn add web3-react @truffle/hdwallet-provider dotenv @openzeppelin/contracts web3-react ethers

Note: depending on your project, you may want to have client side package.json in your src/ folder or at the root. Either would work.

Then you would add the .gitignore for Node projects.  
touch .gitignore

#### Note on dependencies:

[@truffle/hdwallet-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/hdwallet-provider) is necessary to connect your DApp to a what is basically a headless wallet.

[web3-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/injected-connector) provides convenient methods to connect to web3 easily. [wagmi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wagmi) is another library with similar convenience functionality. See their [docs](https://wagmi-xyz.vercel.app/).

For another method to set up a DApp, check out [Scaffold-ETH](http://scaffoldeth.io/) by [Austin Griffith](https://austingriffith.com/). You can also get great DApps examples with [BuidlGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/).

For a full fledged project check out. 0xSparky’s ConsenSys Academy project called [Spread](https://github.com/dinadeljanin/sprd), an options betting platform.

Although it is not a hackathon project, it gives a great example of how React, state management, Solidity, and all the pieces interact cohesively.

See a cool repo? Give it a Github star!

### Web3 Development Basics

If you have a web3 background, you get up to speed on the entire ConsenSys stack to create a DApp. You can use these tools all together or swap them out for another later on.

> How do I test my smart contract?

We recommend using [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) to develop your smart contract first on a local blockchain on your machine. Each account in Ganache comes pre-loaded with test Ether, so you’re all set from the start.

Later you can launch on a Testnet. Remember, if you are using a testnet, you have to get test Ether beforehand. It is required so that you can send transactions and deploy your smart contract.

To get testnet ETH you need a faucet like those linked below. Faucets are programs that give a small amount of tokens. Testnet ETH is NOT real money.

[https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) — Issues testnet tokens from ALL the major testnets, Layer-2 and even test NFTs. Highly recommended.

[https://faucet.ropsten.be/](https://faucet.ropsten.be/) — in case you have to get extra tokens.
